# Integrated Video Analytics Platform

## Get Started
This part will serve as documentation for users. We will update this soon.

## Priority (Bug Fix, Functionality Support, etc.)
Fix parameter_sweeping.

## Naming Convention
To be updated.

## Wishlist
- Parameter sweeping<br />
The recursive function parameter_sweeping already addresses this need. However, 
potential issues and bugs may arise. We are closely watching this feature at 
the moment.
- User can add single instance
- No hard-code
- Load once (for future parallelization)<br />
This has already been addressed.
